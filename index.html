            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Ever since I was a child, I have been a hustler with an appreciation for business and technology. When I was only 14 years old, I was already using my determination and ingenuity to make money. Whether it was shoveling snow, landscaping, or jailbreaking electronics, I always had a techy entrepreneurial spirit inside me. I have grown a lot since then.</p>
            <p>I graduated from Rutgers University in 2022 with a double major in Finance and Management Information Systems. During my time at Rutgers, I was an active student on campus, involved in several professional and fraternal clubs.</p>
            <p>Currently, I work at PwC as a Digital Assurance and Transparency Associate (IT Audit), gaining valuable experience with clients and various business information systems like SAP, Salesforce, Oracle, SailPoint, and Workday. I also run Sena Solutions LLC, providing web development, PPC advertising, and social media management services. One of my significant projects is Lyndhurst07071.com, a political news website with 8,000 monthly visitors.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy coding, gardening, and volunteering. Notably, I spearheaded efforts to build a gazebo in Lewandowski Park in Lyndhurst, NJ, as a community service project. With a passion for people, technology, data, and finance, I aspire to find a role that incorporates all these aspects.</p>
